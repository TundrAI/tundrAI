# 🧊 TundrAI – Documentation Chatbot Project

## 🧭 Project Overview

TundrAI is a **fully open-source, self-hosted AI-powered chatbot** that answers user questions based on documentation content. It will be written in **TypeScript**, with a **React frontend** and a **Node.js backend**, and will use a **self-hosted inference server running open-source LLMs**.

While the primary use case is to support a specific software product, the project is designed to be **documentation-agnostic** — it should work with any set of supported documents and can be used across different software projects or use cases.

TundrAI will be developed and published on the creator's personal GitHub account, and when mature, will be offered to the company for internal integration.

## 🏗️ Repository Architecture **[FINAL]**

**Decision Made: Multi-Repository Structure**

| Repository | Purpose | Issues | Status |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|
| `tundrAI` | **Project hub** - Planning, documentation, architecture overview | 2 | ✅ Created |
| `tundrai-backend` | NestJS API with RAG logic, document processing, authentication | 26 | 🎯 **Current Focus** - Issue #2 |
| `tundrai-frontend` | React + TypeScript chat interface | 10 | ⏳ Later |
| `tundrai-deploy` | Docker orchestration, configs, deployment scripts | 7 | ⏳ Later |
| `tundrai-inference` | Ollama server setup and model management | 0 | ⏳ Future |

**Total Issues: 45 across 5 milestones**

**Current Progress:**
- ✅ Issue #1: NestJS project setup with development tooling (Completed: May 31, 2025)
- 🎯 Issue #2: PostgreSQL + TypeORM + User entity setup (In Progress)

**Why Multi-Repo:**
- Clean service boundaries and independent development
- Each service builds its own Docker image
- Professional separation for company adoption
- Easier to open-source individual components later

## 🧠 Core Workflow

### Step 1: Ingest Documentation
* Supported formats: **PDF**, **Markdown**, **HTML**, and **plain text**
* Documents are parsed and split into chunks
* Chunks are embedded (converted into numerical vectors)
* Embeddings are stored in Qdrant vector database
* Document metadata stored in PostgreSQL

### Step 2: Handle User Questions
* User types a question in the chat UI
* The backend embeds the question using cached embeddings
* Qdrant retrieves the most similar chunks from the docs
* Previous conversation context loaded from PostgreSQL

### Step 3: Generate Answer
* The backend builds a prompt using the question + context + conversation history
* The prompt is sent to Ollama inference server
* The answer is returned to the user
* Conversation is persisted to PostgreSQL

---

## 📂 Document Ingestion Workflow

* **API Endpoints**: `POST /documents/upload` for single files, `POST /documents/batch` for multiple
* **File System Watching**: Automatic processing of files added to configured directories
* **Processing Pipeline**: Parse → Chunk → Embed → Store in Qdrant → Save metadata to PostgreSQL
* **Configurable via environment variables**
* **Original files discarded after processing** (metadata retained)

### Document Versioning
* Git-based versioning for documentation tracking
* Automated re-ingestion triggers via file system monitoring
* Change tracking and incremental updates

---

## 🔐 Authentication Strategy **[FINAL DESIGN]**

### **Flexible Configuration**
```env
ENABLE_AUTH=false|true|hybrid
ALLOW_SELF_REGISTRATION=true|false
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@company.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=initial-secure-password
```

### **JWT + Passport Architecture**
- **Local Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh tokens
- **SSO Ready**: Passport.js strategies for future Google/SAML integration
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin, User, Uploader roles
- **Session Management**: 15-30 min access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens

### **User Management**
- **Self-registration**: Configurable (enable/disable)
- **Admin creation**: Environment variable seeding
- **Password reset**: Email-based + admin override
- **Single-tenant**: One instance per organization (simple, focused)

---

## 🐳 Deployment Strategy **[FINAL APPROACH]**

### **Docker-First Development** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
```yaml
# docker-compose.dev.yml (ACTIVE)
services:
  backend:
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src          # Live code sync
      - /app/node_modules       # Preserve container modules
  postgres:    # User data, conversations
  redis:       # Performance caching  
  qdrant:      # Vector embeddings
  ollama:      # LLM inference (ready to enable)
```

**Docker Commands Available:**
- `pnpm run docker:dev` - Start development environment
- `pnpm run docker:dev:build` - Build and start with latest changes
- `pnpm run docker:dev:down` - Stop all containers
- `pnpm run docker:dev:clean` - Stop and remove all volumes

**Running Services:**
- Backend: http://localhost:3000
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432 (tundrai/tundrai_dev_password)
- Redis: localhost:6379
- Qdrant: localhost:6333 (Web UI at :6333)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Full containerization with hot reload
- ✅ Production-development parity
- ✅ Easy onboarding and deployment

### **Image Strategy**
- Each service repo builds and publishes Docker images
- Deployment repo orchestrates pre-built images
- Supports both local development and remote deployment

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details **[ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS]**

### **API Design Standards**
- **Base URL**: `/api/v1/` (versioned from day 1)
- **Response Format**: `{data, message, success}` wrapper
- **Error Schema**: `{error, message, statusCode, details}`
- **Pagination**: `{data, total, page, limit}` for lists

### **Configuration Management**
- **Environment Variables**: `.env` file with `.env.example` template ✅
- **Environment validation** (fail fast on missing variables)
- **Secrets management** via environment variables

### **Code Quality & Linting** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **ESLint 9** with flat config format (latest approach)
- **Airbnb-style rules** manually configured (not legacy package)
- **TypeScript strict mode** enabled
- **Key rules enforced:**
  - Explicit function return types
  - Import ordering and grouping
  - Interface naming convention (prefixed with 'I')
  - No console.log (except warn/error)
  - Complexity limits (max 10)
  - Max lines per file (300) and function (50)
- **Prettier integration** for consistent formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks** with husky + lint-staged
- **VSCode integration** with auto-fix on save

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit tests** for MVP (faster feedback, easier maintenance)
- **Separate test database** (clean, realistic testing)
- **Integration tests** for RAG pipeline post-MVP
- **100% code coverage requirement** with Jest testing framework
- **Pre-configured Jest** with TypeScript support ✅

### **Logging & Observability**
- **Structured JSON logging** with Winston
- **Log levels**: error, warn, info, debug
- **Performance metrics**: embedding generation time, LLM response time
- **Error tracking**: Built-in logging for MVP, Sentry integration later

### **Caching Strategy**
- **Document embeddings**: Cached in Qdrant (permanent)
- **Query embeddings**: Cached in Redis (temporary)
- **Conversation context**: Recent messages cached in Redis
- **Document metadata**: Frequent lookups cached in Redis

## ⚙️ Configuration & Behavior

### **RAG Mode Configuration**
* **Strict RAG**: Only answer from ingested documents
* **Fallback Mode**: General AI assistance when docs don't contain answer
* Configurable via environment variables

### **Authentication & Access**
* **Public Mode**: Open access chatbot
* **Private Mode**: Requires login to access
* **Hybrid Mode**: Public read, private document upload
* Fully configurable deployment option

### **Language Support**
* **MVP**: English and French
* **Future**: Additional language support planned
